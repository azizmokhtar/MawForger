# WHAT IS MISSING:
1. No Configurable State Management  

There’s no clean abstraction layer for managing state across modules (positions, orders, symbols). Everything seems tightly coupled

2. No Circuit Breakers or Fallbacks  

Critical components like the WebSocket connection lack circuit breakers or fallback mechanisms, leading to potential cascading failures. 

3. Limited Testing Strategy  

No unit tests or mocks are visible. This makes refactoring risky. Create unit tests and integration tests: 
    Mock exchange responses
    Simulate fills, errors, timeouts
    Test edge cases like duplicate orders, partial fills
     

Use pytest, unittest, or hypothesis for property-based testing. 

4. Lack of Health Checks and Observability  

There’s no way to monitor health metrics, track performance, or log detailed analytics. Periodically check: 
    WebSocket ping latency
    Exchange API uptime
    Memory usage
    Task queue length
    If something fails repeatedly, auto-restart subsystems or notify admins. 

5. Error Handling is Not Centralized  

Errors are caught in multiple places but not handled consistently. There's also no alerting escalation system. 

6. Hardcoded Behavior  

Many behaviors (like order types, exit strategies, symbol management) are hardcoded instead of being configurable via a strategy engine. 

7. Concurrency Issues  

You're using asyncio.create_task(), but concurrency patterns aren’t well-managed across services (e.g., shared state without locks). 

8. No centralised event bus

Use an event-driven architecture to decouple components. For example: 
    When a position opens → publish POSITION_OPENED event
    When a fill occurs → publish FILL_RECEIVED
    Listeners can react accordingly (e.g., update UI, send alerts)
    This allows better modularity and testing. 


# ARCHITECTURE:
Core Engine
	Orchestrates everything else; manages lifecycle, restarts, health checks.

Config Manager
	Loads and validates config from secure sources (e.g., Vault, encrypted files).

State Manager
	Manages all runtime state: positions, open orders, history, etc. Thread-safe.

Exchange Adapter Layer
	Abstracts exchange-specific logic (Hyperliquid here). Add support for Binance, Bybit, etc.

Strategy Engine
	Pluggable module that decides when to enter/exit positions based on indicators, signals, or rules.

Order Execution Module
	Handles actual order placement with retry logic, throttling, rate limiting, and slippage control.

Risk Manager
	Validates each trade against risk parameters (position size, max drawdown, etc.).

Notifier / Alert System
	Sends messages via Telegram, Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc. Supports priority levels.

Logger / Auditor
	Logs every action and decision for auditing, replay, and debugging.

Health Checker
	Monitors system health, latency, memory, disk, API response times. Triggers alerts or fallbacks.

Backtester / Simulator
	Runs strategies in backtest or sandbox mode before going live.
